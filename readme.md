This project is a pure Python backend that uses the Mistral AI API to analyze exam questions and extract the most frequently occurring high-level topics. It's perfect for competitive exams, semester question paper analysis, and education-focused AI applications.

Just Load YOur Papers(pdf form) in /papers and run main.py

## üöÄ Features

* üîç Analyze multiple questions in one go
* üéØ Extract 5‚Äì6 most common technical topics
* ‚ö° Powered by Mistral API
* üìÇ Simple script-based usage (`main.py`)
* üõ°Ô∏è Environment-safe with `.env` file



## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/mahivram/Paper_Analyzer.git
cd paper-analyzer


### 2. Create a virtual environment

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate


### 3. Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py


Make sure your `important_questions.txt` file exists and contains one question per line.



## üßæ Dependencies

Install these using `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

Generate `requirements.txt` if needed:

bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
